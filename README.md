Real-Estate-Data-Analysis


Description:

This project focuses on analyzing real estate data from Australia to answer statistical questions and test hypotheses. 
Using the property.csv dataset, we explore property prices in different suburbs, seasonal price variations, and probabilities of certain property features. 
The analysis includes hypothesis testing, t-tests, and probability calculations, providing insights into the real estate market. 
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with the analysis and supporting scripts to replicate the results. 
Ideal for those interested in applying statistical methods to real-world data and making data-driven decisions in real estate.

Typical Property Price in Altona:
Performed a one-sample t-test to determine if the mean property price in Altona is significantly different from $800,000.


Price Difference Between Summer and Winter Months in 2016:
Compared property prices in summer and winter months using a two-sample t-test.


Probability of No Car Parking in Abbotsford:
Calculated the probability using the binomial distribution.


Probability of Finding a Property with 3 Rooms in Abbotsford:
Calculated the probability of finding a property with exactly 3 rooms.


Probability of Finding a Property with 2 Bathrooms in Abbotsford:
